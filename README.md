## Overview

This guide helps you build a Rubik’s Cube solver from scratch, step by step — from thinking about how to model the cube, through coding moves and solve logic, to organizing your project and testing it.

---

## 1. Problem Understanding

**Goal:**  
Implement an algorithm that solves the standard 3×3 Rubik’s Cube from any scrambled state, using legal cube moves.

---

## 2. Cube Representation

**Data Structures:**  
The cube has 6 faces, each face is a 3×3 grid of stickers (colors).

- Use a 3D array: `cube[face][row][col]` — OR  
- Use a flat 1D array: `cube[0...53]`

**Python Example:**
Representing the cube: 6 faces (indices 0-5), each with a 3x3 grid
cube = [[[0 for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(6)]


*Tip: Assign an integer or char for each color per face.*

---

## 3. Defining Moves

**Concept:**  
Each move (U, D, L, R, F, B, along with their ' (prime/inverse) and 2 (double) versions) rotates a part of the cube.

**Implementation Approach:**

- Define a function for each move: e.g. `def move_U(cube): ...`
- Each function should change the relevant elements in your cube’s data structure to mimic a physical move.

**Start Simple:**  
Implement one move, test it, then add more.

---

## 4. Simulating Moves & Checking State

**Move Simulator:**  
After each move, update the cube’s data structure.

**State Checker — Is the Cube Solved?**
def is_solved(cube):
# Each face should have same color on all 9 spots
for face in cube:
if len({face[i][j] for i in range(3) for j in range(3)}) != 1:
return False
return True



---

## 5. The Solving Algorithm

**Beginner’s Layer-by-Layer Method:**  
_Solve in these logical stages (each can be a function):_
1. White Cross
2. White Corners
3. Middle Edges
4. Yellow Cross
5. Yellow Corners

**Tip:**  
Make a function for each stage.  
Advanced: Try search algorithms (BFS/IDA*) for optimization later.

---

## 6. Code Structure

Organize your code as modules or in classes/functions for clarity:

- `cube.py` → Cube data structure + move functions
- `solver.py` → Solving algorithm & state checker
- `utils.py` → Helper functions (scramble, print cube), optional

(Or, for smaller projects, keep everything in one `.py` file.)

---

## 7. Example Code Snippets

**Defining a Move (U-turn) Example in Python:**
def move_U(cube):
# Rotate the U (top) face clockwise
face = cube
cube = [list(reversed(col)) for col in zip(*face)]
# Rotate affected edge stickers (implement correct swaps)
# ... your code here ...


**Checking if Cube is Solved:**  
(See code above in section 4.)

---

## 8. Output & Testing

- Output the moves needed to solve a given scramble in standard notation.
- Print both the initial scramble and the solution.

**Sample Output:**
Scrambled: U R U' F2 ...
Solution: F' R U2 D ...



---

## 9. Project Workflow

_Steps to implement (you can follow as a to-do list):_
1. Model the cube’s data structure.
2. Write code for the legal moves (U, D, L, R, F, B, and their primes/2x).
3. Make a function to check if the cube is solved.
4. Code the beginner’s solution as stepwise functions.
5. Scramble your cube, run your solver, and print the solution sequence.

---

## 10. Tips for Beginners

- **Incremental Build:** Write and test one small function at a time.
- **Correctness First:** Make sure moves/state tracking works before focusing on efficiency.
- **Document Well:** Use comments and this markdown to keep everything understandable.
- **Look for Inspiration:** If stuck, check simple open-source cube solvers, but don’t copy—understand!
